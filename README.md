# 1_keras_fashion_mnist
Convolutional Neural Network in Keras for image classification We will use keras fashion MNIST dataset. This consist of 60000, 28X28 pixel images and 10000 test images, these images are classified in one of the 10 categories  we are using TensorFlow as our backend and applying activation functions like Relu, Softmax on model. Each image is 28 x 28 pixel in dimension
The 10 Categories are:

1.T-shirt/top

2.Trouser

3.Pullover

4.Dress

5.Coat

6.Sandal

7.Shirt

8.Sneaker
